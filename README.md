## Me in a nutshell
>I am a mathematician, specialized in Algebra and its applications. I found it fascinating to work with Module Theory, Lattice Theory, and ultimately, Category Theory which I intend to apply within pure mathematics and other sciences as well.
>I started studying the career of pure mathematics at UNAM, Mexico, where I continued with my studies until getting my PhD degree under the supervision of Dr. Hugo Alberto Rincon Mejia.
